Welcome to my portfolio website code!

As I'm creating it, I'm also learning a bit more about React and its inner workings. 
I've become a bit more acquainted with creating an API and receiving its data, using useState and useEffect, and taking advantage of Javascript and CSS animations to bring you a simple and elegant design with punches of color.

Since the API load is a bit slow, don't hesitate to refresh twice to see the page in all its glory. I'm looking for solutions to this problem, including using React Query.
